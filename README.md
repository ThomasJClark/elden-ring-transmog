# Elden Ring Transmogrify Mod

A mod for Elden Ring that allows you to modify the cosmetic appearance of your armor while keeping the original stats intact. You can make armor pieces resemble any other piece in the game, or make them invisible to benefit from their effects without covering up your character. Compatible with game version 1.10, The Convergence Mod, and Elden Ring Reforged.
